            <h1>Project Description</h1>
            <p1>For the 2020 BlueMovement Bootcamp through IBM, black students across the nation from varying univerisites and education backgrounds were given the opportunity to respond to the following prompt:</p1>
            <br><br>
            <p1>The Black community in America has been under attack for over 400+ years. From unjust violence to systematic oppression to environmental health bias, our communities have constantly sought equity, safety, and fair treatment within our nation. We are now in a position to stand and demand what we want: Solution-oriented change.</p1>
            <br><br>
            <p1>As developers working behind a screen it <strong>can prove difficult to contribute to our personal causes in ways that we see fit.</strong> This year’s 2020 Blue Movement group project focus will be all about using our development skills to create innovative technological solutions that will directly impact the greater movement of Black American Protection under the Law, Safety, and Mental Wellbeing. With this focus in mind, your team has the freedom to create any technological innovation that they see fit. Be creative and intentional about the purpose of your group’s work.</p1>
